# Fine-Tuned Masked Language Model

This repository contains a fine-tuned version of the `distilbert-base-uncased` model, optimized for masked language modeling tasks. The fine-tuning process has resulted in a model that performs effectively on an unknown dataset with specific evaluation metrics detailed below.

## Model Performance

The model achieves the following results on the evaluation set:

- **Loss:** 2.4252

## Model Description

This model builds on `distilbert-base-uncased`, a smaller, faster, cheaper, and lighter version of BERT, while retaining 97% of BERT’s language understanding. It has been fine-tuned to predict masked tokens in sentences, making it suitable for various natural language processing tasks that require contextual understanding.

## Intended Uses & Limitations

- **Intended Uses:** The model can be used for any task requiring a deep understanding of language context, such as text completion, data augmentation, and other NLP applications.
- **Limitations:** Specific details about the dataset and potential biases are not provided, and the model’s performance is only validated on the evaluation set. Use caution when applying it to significantly different contexts or domains.

## Training and Evaluation Data

- **Training Data:** Details about the training dataset are needed.
- **Evaluation Data:** The evaluation set used to validate the model is not specified. 

## Training Procedure

The model was trained with the following hyperparameters:

- **Learning Rate:** 2e-05
- **Train Batch Size:** 64
- **Eval Batch Size:** 64
- **Seed:** 42
- **Optimizer:** Adam with `betas=(0.9, 0.999)` and `epsilon=1e-08`
- **Learning Rate Scheduler Type:** Linear
- **Number of Epochs:** 3.0
- **Mixed Precision Training:** Native AMP

### Training Results

| Training Loss | Epoch | Step | Validation Loss |
|---------------|-------|------|-----------------|
| 2.3173        | 1.0   | 157  | 2.3981          |
| 2.3598        | 2.0   | 314  | 2.3818          |
| 2.3838        | 3.0   | 471  | 2.4175          |

## Framework Versions

- **Transformers:** 4.41.1
- **Pytorch:** 2.3.0+cu121
- **Datasets:** 2.19.1
- **Tokenizers:** 0.19.1

## Installation

To install and use the fine-tuned model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cxx5208/Finetuned-MLM-accelerate.git
   cd Finetuned-MLM-accelerate
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Loading the Model

To load the model and tokenizer, use the following code:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "path_to_your_finetuned_model"
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

### Inference Example

Here is an example of how to use the model for masked language modeling:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "path_to_your_finetuned_model"
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Example sentence with a masked token
sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy [MASK]."
inputs = tokenizer(sentence, return_tensors="pt")
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Get the predictions for the masked token
predictions = outputs.logits
masked_index = (inputs.input_ids == tokenizer.mask_token_id).nonzero(as_tuple=True)[1]
predicted_token_id = predictions[0, masked_index].argmax(axis=-1)
predicted_token = tokenizer.decode(predicted_token_id)

print(f"Predicted token: {predicted_token}")
```

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model on a custom dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in a format compatible with the Hugging Face `datasets` library.
2. Use the following code to evaluate:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load your dataset
dataset = load_dataset("path_to_your_dataset")

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
)

# Initialize the Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    eval_dataset=dataset['validation']
)

# Evaluate the model
results = trainer.evaluate()
print(results)
```
